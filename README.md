# Project: Button Counter 

In this project I was tasked with creating a counter that allows the user to add, subtract and reset the counter. The user can also choose a custom input that allows them to set how they want to add/subtract.

To run ths project locally you wull need to use npm install and npm run dev in the termianl of your device.

To build this project use npm run build and npm start in the terminal.

Features implemented in this project:
A live character count that updates in real time
Buttons that allow the user to increase, decrease, and reset the chatacter count
A custom step input that allows the user to set how much they want to add/subtract
Logic to prevent the count from going below zero

Known Issues and limitations:
There are no known issues or limitations for this project.
